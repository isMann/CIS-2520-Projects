For this project 3 IMDB .tsv files were read in and created binary search trees. 6 BSTs were created.<br>
 1. Actor names and IDs
 2. Actor IDs and names
 3. Title names and IDs
 4. Title IDs and names
 5. Actor IDs and Title IDs
 6. Title IDs and Name IDs<p>
 
 The rest of the program prompts the user to search for an actor or a title. If the user searches for an actor it will use the trees to search for every film that actor appeared in. If the user searches for a title it will display every actor in the film.
